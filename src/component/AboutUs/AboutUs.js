                            <p className="col-10 mx-auto">As of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic situation is still a huge concern to everyone around the world. Due to the unclear symptoms of the virus, citizens have a lot of questions about the current circumstance or how to deal with a specific situation (Ex: How to treat F0 and F1 patients, how to self-isolate at home, etc.). Another reason is that face-to-face check-ups with doctors are unavailable, this could lead to some problems that citizens are unaware of (Ex: Mistaking common diseasesâ€™ symptoms with COVID-19 ones, etc.).
                                <br></br>For those reasons, our team builds a Medical Consultation system which helps citizens and patients easily communicate with doctors anywhere and anytime they want to. The main purpose of the project is to make a website where doctors and patients can socialize by asking and answering questions regarding covid-19 virus. Not only can doctors answer questions posted by patients, but they can also post medical articles to inform as many people as possible.
